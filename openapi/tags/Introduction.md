The Data Repository Service (DRS) API provides a generic interface to data repositories so data consumers, including workflow systems, can access data objects in a single, standard way regardless of where they are stored and how they are managed. The primary functionality of DRS is to map a logical ID to a means for physically retrieving the data represented by the ID. The sections below describe the characteristics of those IDs, the types of data supported, how they can be pointed to using URIs, and how clients can use these URIs to ultimately make successful DRS API requests. This document also describes the DRS API in detail and provides information on the specific endpoints, request formats, and responses. This specification is intended for developers of DRS-compatible services and of clients that will call these DRS services.

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
