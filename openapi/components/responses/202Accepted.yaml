      To simplify client response processing, this must be an integral relative time in seconds.
      This value SHOULD represent the minimum duration the client should wait before attempting
      the operation again with a reasonable expectation of success. When it is not feasible
      for the server to determine the actual expected delay, the server may return a
      brief, fixed value instead.
